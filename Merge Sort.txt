Merge Sort is a highly efficient and comparison-based sorting algorithm known for its stable sorting property. It follows the divide-and-conquer strategy, dividing the input array into smaller subarrays until they are small enough to be sorted easily. Then, it merges these sorted subarrays back together to produce the final sorted array.

Here's how Merge Sort works:

Divide: Divide the unsorted array into two halves until each subarray contains only one element (a single element is inherently sorted).
Conquer: Recursively sort each subarray.
Merge: Combine the sorted subarrays into a single sorted array by repeatedly comparing and merging elements from both subarrays.
Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), which makes it highly efficient for sorting large datasets. It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that it maintains the relative order of equal elements. Additionally, Merge Sort is well-suited for sorting linked lists as well as arrays.

The main advantage of Merge Sort over other sorting algorithms like Quick Sort is its consistent performance, as it guarantees a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). However, it may require additional memory space for the temporary subarrays, which can be a drawback for very large datasets.

In summary, DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as deeply as possible before backtracking, while Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that employs the divide-and-conquer strategy to efficiently sort arrays or lists. Both algorithms are fundamental in computer science and have numerous real-world applications.
